Coursework for the module Digitising Cultural Heritage Material during Master's programme: Library and Information Science, Digital Library and Information Services at University of Borås.
This project aims to digitise the diary of my great-grandmother, Helen Borthwick, which covers the years 1913-1919. Shortly after beginning her diary, the first world war broke out, and she signed up with the Scottish Women’s Hospitals For Foreign Service, where she served as a nurse in Serbia.
